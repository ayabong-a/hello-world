This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.
Heres's a little info about myself:
I am someone who has a knack for creativity and problem-solving. I have a lot of interests ranging from science and technology to art and literature. I love connecting with others to share ideas and experiences and I believe that kind of thing is essential for growth amongst myself and my peers. Some of my hobbies include chess, sports(e.g pool and soccer), playing piano and coding!
